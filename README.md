# The-Legend-of-Chris

A game based on the original Legend of Zelda.

This is a game that I have made in my spare time to test my programming and game making skills. 
I originally made a similar game in grade 12 but I wanted to improve on it with the knowledge I have gained from University and being in the workforce.
Some of these improvements are using object oriented principles, following a game loop (update, check events and draw), using 
superclasses and subclasses, using different data structures, improved collisions and sprite movement/animation, and more.
